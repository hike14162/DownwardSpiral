# DownwardSpiral
Downward Spiral Challenge for the Senior iOS Developer (Swift) position at The Sufferfest.

My DSC solution was created in Xcode 10.1 using Swift 4.2.  I created a dynamic graph that updates over time (seconds) following the data in the specified json data file. My DSC simulates the progress of the Downward Spiral over time (55min).  The simulation can be run in real time, at 2X speed, 5X speed and 10X speed.   

To run, tap the play button on the navigation bar, select a speed to run the simulation at then confirm by tapping the play button.  This will close the dialog and start the simulation. To end the simulation, tap the X on the navigation bar.

Chart:
For the charting on this challenge, I used a port of “MPAndroidChart” by Daniel Cohen Gindi & Philipp Jahoda.   I made no modifications to the charting code but instead used it as is.
